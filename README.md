## How It Works

### Multi-Scale Discovery Approach

The platform implements a unique research methodology that combines:

1. **Broad Search**: Start with general terms across multiple domains
2. **Term Extraction**: Extract 5 key terms from each research page
3. **Combination**: Combine terms to create more specific searches
4. **Expansion**: Open new research avenues with combined terms
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the process to drill deeper or broader

Think of it like examining a silver dollar:
- **Macroscale**: The entire collection of silver dollars
- **Microscale**: The specific die pair that made each coin
- **Discovery**: Finding rare variations by combining multiple attributes

### Research Workflow

```
Initial Search → Open 40 Pages → Extract Terms → Combine Terms → Expand Research
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓                ↓
  General      Specific Topics   Key Concepts   Intersections   New Discoveries
```
